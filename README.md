# Meta Tag Game

## Intro

As museums add collections online, the language that describes the objects - known as metadata - affects how people find and search for these objects; this same issue of language affecting search is also a part of your everyday life online! The language choices made by museum staff and website creators around the world are based on standards and rules. This means access is often limited to only those who understand the style used.

As part of this game you can see how language and word choice may affect your ability to find things. To begin, you will be shown an image of an object in the Adler’s collection along with all the words that make it searchable online -- it’s metadata! Some of these terms were created by museum staff, some were created by AI and machine learning, and some were created by users like you! As the words fall it’s your job to collect them. Any words that you would use to describe the image you move to the right and any words you don’t think describe the image you move to the left. 

There is no right or wrong answer here! We want to know what you find useful! And after you select the terms created by others, we ask you to add your own! You are invited to add any additional words or phrases you think would be helpful to describe the image shown. 

Help the Adler improve access to our collections by tagging images with the words you would use to search for these images. There is no single right answer. You do not need to know what a certain thing is, or who a certain person is. We want to know how you would describe what you are looking at to a friend, or how you would describe an image to find it again later. That’s your language, and we want to include it!
